# qfix
A collection of quick fixes: probably poor documented and possibly unstable 
funcitons that's might be useful anyway to ME. Use at own risk, functions might 
be randomly added, deprecated or broken from time to time.  
  
Depends on a lot of CRAN-packages just to get my standard packages installed.
