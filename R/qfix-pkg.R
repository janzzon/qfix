#' qfix: A collection of misc quick fix functions
#'
#' A collection of probably poor documented and possibly unstable
#' funcitons that's might be useful anyway to ME. Use at own risk, functions might
#' be randomly added, deprecated or broken from time to time.
#' A lot of (my) common used packages is listed as Imports: in DESCRIPTION to
#' to ensure they're installed.
